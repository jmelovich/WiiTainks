# Wii Tainks!
## Warnings:
### - Do NOT import any file larger than 100mb into the project, it will prevent it from being uploaded to github and will break the repo for everyone else
### - Do NOT add a C++ file to the project as it will then convert the project to a C++ project which requires Visual Studio (which will break the install for everyone else)

## Dependencies:
### - Unreal Engine 5.3.2
### - The Learning Agents plugin 
- (follow the beginning of [this tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/qj2O/unreal-engine-learning-to-drive) for where to enable the plugin)
